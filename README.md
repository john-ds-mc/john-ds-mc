# Hey, I'm John

I build AI-powered products. Currently working on [Lettie](https://lettie.uk) — an AI agent that watches every new London rental listing, learns your taste, and sends enquiries automatically.

### Open source

| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| [lettie-cli](https://github.com/john-ds-mc/lettie-cli) | Search Rightmove listings from your terminal. `--json` output for AI agents. Available on Homebrew. |
| [react-swipe-stack](https://github.com/john-ds-mc/react-swipe-stack) | Tinder-style swipeable card stack for React. Framer Motion gestures, image gallery, fully customisable. |
| [postmark-inbound](https://github.com/john-ds-mc/postmark-inbound) | Parse Postmark inbound webhook payloads. Zero dependencies, works with any framework. |
